## A simple app to implement Bearer token auth flow

Bearer token authentication for APIs is a way to ensure that only authorized users can access specific API endpoints. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. The user logs in to the API using their username and password.
2. If the login is successful, the API generates a unique "bearer token" for the user and sends it back in the response.
3. The user stores this token on their device or in their browser.
4. Whenever the user wants to access a protected endpoint on the API, they include the bearer token in the request.
5. The API checks the token to make sure it's valid and belongs to an authorized user.
6. If the token is valid, the API returns the requested data or performs the requested action. If the token is invalid, the API returns an error message.

One advantage of using bearer token authentication for APIs is that it allows users to authenticate once and then access multiple endpoints without having to log in again. This can make the user experience smoother and reduce the load on the server.

Here are some common use cases for bearer token authentication in APIs, of course this is not an exhausted list of use cases by no means:

- Social media apps, where users have different levels of access to data depending on their role (e.g. a user vs. an administrator).
- E-commerce sites, where users need to authenticate to access their shopping cart, order history, and other personal information.
- SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms, where different customers may have access to different features or data depending on their subscription plan.
- Mobile apps, where bearer tokens can be used to authenticate API requests even when the user is offline.

One thing to keep in mind is that bearer tokens can be vulnerable to attacks like interception or theft if they are not implemented securely. It's important to use HTTPS encryption to protect the token during transmission and store the token securely on the client side.

Overall, bearer token authentication is a flexible and secure way to control access to API endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions or access certain data.
